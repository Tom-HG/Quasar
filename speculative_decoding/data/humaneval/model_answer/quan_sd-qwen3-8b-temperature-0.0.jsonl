The user provided a Python function called below_threshold that takes a list and an integer, and returns True if all numbers in the list are below the threshold. They also included some doctests. My task is to complete the code.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the function is supposed to do. The docstring says to return True if all numbers in l are below t. So, for example, in the first test case, the list is [1,2,4,10] and the threshold is 100. All elements are less than 100, so it returns True. In the second example, the list has 20 which is above 5, so it returns False.\n\nSo the function needs to check every element in the list and ensure that each is less than t. If any element is >= t, the function should return False. Otherwise, return True.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Python. The function is called below_threshold, taking l (a list) and t (an integer). The function needs to check all elements in l are less than t.\n\nA straightforward approach would be to iterate through each element in the list and check if it's less than t. If any element is not less than t, return False. If all are less, return True.\n\nBut wait, how to handle empty lists? Well, according to the problem statement, maybe the list can be empty? But the doctests don't cover that. However, the function should handle all cases.\n\nLet me think about the logic. For all elements in l, check if element < t. If all are true, return True. Else, False.\n\nSo, in code terms, perhaps using a loop. Or using list comprehensions?\n\nFor example:\n\ndef below_threshold(l, t):\n    for num in l:\n        if num >= t:\n            return False\n    return True\n\nWait, that's one way. But what if the list is empty? Then the loop doesn't run, and returns True. Which is correct because if there are no elements, then all elements (none) are below the threshold. So that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, using all() function. Because the all() function returns True if all elements in the iterable are True. So, if we check for each element in l whether it's less than t, then all(...).\n\nSo:\n\ndef below_threshold(l, t):\n    return all(num < t for num in l)\n\nWait, but wait, the all() function will check each element. Let me think. For example, if l is [1,2,3], t is 4. Then all(num < t for num in l) would check each num < 4. So 1<4 is True, 2<4 is True, 3<4 is True. So all returns True. Which is correct.\n\nIf any element is >= t, then the generator expression would have a False, so all() would return False. Which is correct.\n\nSo this code would work. But wait, what about the case where the list is empty? Then all() would return True, which is correct. Because if there are no elements, then all elements are below the threshold (since there's nothing to contradict it). So that's correct.\n\nSo the function can be written as:\n\ndef below_threshold(l, t):\n    return all(num < t for num in l)\n\nBut wait, the generator expression is num < t for num in l. So the all() function checks each element in l. So yes.\n\nBut wait, the original code uses a list comprehension in the all() function. Wait, no, the all() function takes an iterable. So the generator expression is num < t for num in l. So for each num in l, check if num < t. So all() will return True only if all elements are True.\n\nSo yes, that's correct.\n\nSo the code can be written as a single line.\n\nBut let me check the doctests.\n\nFirst example: below_threshold([1,2,4,10], 100). All elements are less than 100? 1 < 100 is True, 2 < 100, etc. So all returns True. So the function returns True. Which matches the doctest.\n\nSecond example: below_threshold([1,20,4,10], 5). The elements are 1, 20, 4, 10. Check if each is less than 5. 20 is not, so all returns False. So function returns False. Which matches the doctest.\n\nSo this code would work.\n\nBut wait, the user provided the function definition with the parameters l and t.

The user provided a Python function called remove_vowels and some test cases. They want me to complete the code. So the function is supposed to remove vowels from a string. Let me think about how the function should do.\n\nFirst, the vowels are a, e, i, o, u, both lowercase and uppercase? Wait, the test cases include 'aaBAA' which becomes 'B'. So in that case, the uppercase 'A' is considered a vowel. So the function needs to remove all vowels regardless of case. So vowels are both lower and uppercase.\n\nSo the function needs to iterate through each character in the input text and check if it's a vowel. If it's not, keep it; otherwise, remove it.\n\nSo the approach would be: loop through each character in the text, check if it's a vowel (case-insensitive?), then build a new string with only non-vowel characters.\n\nWait, but how to handle case? For example, in the test case 'aaBAA' becomes 'B'. So the 'B' is uppercase, which suggests that the function is removing all vowels regardless of their case. So 'A' and 'a' are vowels, same with 'B' being a consonant.\n\nSo the function needs to check if a character is a vowel, regardless of case. So perhaps converting each character to lowercase (or uppercase) and check against a set of vowels.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Define a set of vowels, maybe lowercase vowels, then check each character in the text. For each character, if it's in the vowels set (case-insensitive?), then exclude it. Otherwise, include it.\n\nWait, but how to handle case? For example, if the character is uppercase, like 'A', then converting it to lowercase and checking against the lowercase vowels would work.\n\nSo perhaps the code would be:\n\ndef remove_vowels(text):\n    vowels = {'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'}\n    result = []\n    for char in text:\n        if char.lower() not in vowels:\n            result.append(char)\n    return ''.join(result)\n\nWait, but wait. Let me think again. For each character in text, we check if it's a vowel. But if the character is uppercase, like 'A', then char.lower() would be 'a', which is in vowels. So we would exclude it. So that's correct.\n\nSo the code would loop through each character, check if it's a vowel (case-insensitive), and if not, add it to the result.\n\nBut let me test this logic with the test cases.\n\nFirst test case: remove_vowels('') returns ''. That's handled.\n\nSecond test case: remove_vowels(\"abcdef\\nghijklm\") \u2192 'bcdf\\nghjklm'. Let's see. The input string is \"abcdef\\nghijklm\". Let's break it down:\n\nOriginal string: a, b, c, d, e, f, newline, g, h, i, j, k, l, m.\n\nRemoving vowels (a, e, i, o, u). So the vowels in the input are a, e, i. So the characters that are kept are b, c, d, f, then newline, then g, h, j, k, l, m. So the output is 'bcdf\\nghjklm'. Which matches the test case.\n\nAnother test case: remove_vowels('aaaaa') \u2192 ''. All a's, so all removed.\n\nAnother test case: remove_vowels('aaBAA') \u2192 'B'. So the 'aaBAA' has a's and A's. So after removing vowels, only 'B' remains.\n\nSo the code above would work.\n\nWait, but in the code, for each character, we check if char.lower() is in vowels. Wait, no. Wait, the code says: if char.lower() not in vowels: then append. So vowels is {'a','e','i','o','u'}, so if char.lower() is in vowels, then it's a vowel and we remove it.

Let me read the problem again. The task is to write a function that takes a string and returns the sum of the ASCII codes of the upper characters only. Oh right, so upper characters here probably mean uppercase letters, like 'A' to 'Z'. Wait, but the examples might clarify that.\n\nLooking at the examples. For instance, digitSum(\"abAB\") returns 131. Let's break that down. The string is 'a', 'b', 'A', 'B'. The upper characters are 'A' and 'B'. Their ASCII codes are 65 and 66. Adding those gives 65+66=131. Which matches the example. So the function needs to sum the ASCII values of all uppercase letters in the string, ignoring lowercase letters.\n\nWait, but wait. What about characters that are not letters? Like digits or symbols? The problem says \"upper characters only\", but maybe it's referring to uppercase letters. So, the function should sum the ASCII codes of all uppercase letters in the string. Lowercase letters are ignored, and other characters (like digits or symbols) are also ignored?\n\nSo, for example, in \"abcCd\", the uppercase letters are 'C' and 'D'? Let me check the example. The example says digitSum(\"abcCd\") => 67. Let's see: the string is 'a', 'b', 'c', 'C', 'd'. The uppercase letters are 'C' (ASCII 67) and maybe 'D'? Wait, no. Wait the string is \"abcCd\". So the letters are a, b, c, C, d. So uppercase is C. So sum is 67? Wait, 67 is the ASCII code for 'C'. So the sum is 67? But the example says digitSum(\"abcCd\") returns 67. So that's correct. So the function sums the ASCII codes of all uppercase letters in the string.\n\nSo the approach is: iterate through each character in the string, check if it's an uppercase letter (A-Z), and if so, add its ASCII code to the sum.\n\nSo how to implement that in Python.\n\nThe function needs to process each character in the input string s. For each character, check if it is uppercase. How to do that? Well, in Python, we can check if a character is uppercase using the isupper() method. But wait, sometimes uppercase letters may have accents or other characters, but I think in this problem, it's just the standard uppercase letters A-Z.\n\nSo for each character in s, if it's an uppercase letter (A-Z), then add its ASCII value to the sum.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nInitialize a sum variable to 0.\n\nLoop through each character in the string s:\n\n   if the character is uppercase (A-Z), then add its ASCII code to the sum.\n\nReturn the sum.\n\nSo how to implement that.\n\nIn Python, for each char in s:\n\nif char.isupper():\n\n   sum += ord(char)\n\nWait, but wait, the problem says \"upper characters only\". So maybe it's not just uppercase letters, but perhaps any character that is considered an uppercase letter? But in Python, the isupper() method returns True for uppercase letters, and False for lowercase letters and other characters.\n\nSo, for example, 'A'.isupper() is True, 'a'.isupper() is False, '1'.isupper() is False.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef digitSum(s):\n    total = 0\n    for char in s:\n        if char.isupper():\n            total += ord(char)\n    return total\n\nWait, but let's check the examples.\n\nFirst example: digitSum(\"\") => 0. That's correct.\n\nSecond example: \"abAB\" => sum of A and B. A is 65, B is 66. 65+67=131? Wait 65+66 is 131. Yes. So that's correct.\n\nThird example: \"abcCd\" => the uppercase letters are C. So 67? Yes. So the sum is 67. Which matches the example.\n\nFourth example: \"helloE\" => the uppercase is E. ASCII code is 69. So sum is 69. Which matches the example.\n\nAnother example: \"woArBld\" => uppercase letters are O, A, R, B. Wait let me check the string. Let's see:\n\nThe string is 'w', 'o', 'A', 'r', 'B', 'l', 'd'.

For each i from 1 to n, a[i] = i*i -i +1. Wait, but in Python, lists are zero-indexed, but the problem says for i from 1 to n. Wait, the example input is n=5, and the array a is [1,3,7,13,21].

Wait, but the problem says \"for each i (1 \u2264 i \u2264 n)\", so the array a has length n, and a[1] is the first element? Or maybe the problem uses 1-based indexing? Because in the example, for n=5, the array is [1,3,7,13,21], which has 5 elements. So when they refer to a[i], it's the ith element in the array, but the array is 1-based? Or maybe the array is zero-based? Wait, no. Let me think again. The problem says \"create an integer array a of length n.\" So for n=5, the array has 5 elements. Then, for each i from 1 to n, a[i] is computed. Wait, but in programming, arrays are zero-based. But maybe the problem uses 1-based indexing. So for i=1 to n, a[i] = i\u00b2 -i +1. But in Python, if we create a list with indices starting from 0, then a[0] would be for i=1? That's confusing. Wait, perhaps the problem uses 1-based indexing. So for example, when n=5, the array a has elements a[1], a[2], ..., a[5], each computed as i\u00b2 -i +1. Then, when they refer to a[i], a[j], a[k], it's the elements at positions i, j, k in the array. But then, the array's length is n, so i ranges from 1 to n. So for the example, n=5, the array is [1,3,7,13,21], which are the values for i=1 to 5. So the array is 1-based. But when we create it in Python, we'd probably create a list starting from index 0, but maybe the problem uses 1-based indices. So perhaps the array is stored as a list starting from index 0, but the elements a[0] corresponds to i=1? Or maybe not. Wait, perhaps the problem's array is zero-based. Let me check the example again. The example says for n=5, the array is [1,3,7,13,21]. So the length is 5. So for i from 1 to 5, a[i] is computed. But in Python, if we have a list a, then a[0] would be the first element. But according to the example, when i=1, a[i] is 1. So if the array is zero-based, then for i=1, a[i-1] would be 1. But perhaps the problem uses 1-based indexing. So the array a has elements from index 1 to n. But in Python, lists are zero-based. So perhaps the code should generate a list where a[i] is the value for i-th element, but in Python, we have to generate a list with elements from index 0 to n-1, but the problem's indices are 1-based.

So, for example, when n is 15, the largest divisor is 5 because 15 divided by 5 is 3, and 5 is less than 15. Wait, but wait, isn't 15's divisors 1, 3, 5, 15? Oh right, but we need the largest one that's smaller than n. So 5 is the answer here.\n\nSo the task is to find the largest proper divisor of n. Proper here meaning less than n. So how do I approach this?\n\nFirst, I remember that the largest divisor of n less than n is n divided by its smallest prime factor. Wait, maybe not. Let me think. For example, take n=15. Its divisors are 1, 3, 5, 15. The largest one less than 15 is 5. So how do I find that?\n\nAnother approach: The largest proper divisor of n is n divided by its smallest prime factor. Wait, maybe not. Let's think. For example, take n=15. The smallest prime factor is 3 (since 15 factors into 3*5). Then n divided by that is 5. Which is the correct answer. So maybe that's a way to approach it.\n\nSo the idea is to find the smallest prime factor of n, then divide n by that to get the largest proper divisor. But how do I find the smallest prime factor?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can iterate from 2 up to sqrt(n) and check for divisors. Because the largest proper divisor would be n divided by the smallest divisor greater than 1. Wait, maybe that's a better approach.\n\nLet me think. For example, for n=15, the smallest divisor greater than 1 is 3. Then n divided by that is 5, which is the largest proper divisor. For n=12, the smallest divisor greater than 1 is 2. 12/2 is 6, which is the largest proper divisor. That seems to work.\n\nSo the approach could be: find the smallest divisor of n greater than 1, then divide n by that to get the largest proper divisor.\n\nBut how do I find that smallest divisor?\n\nWell, I can loop from 2 to sqrt(n) and check for divisibility. Once I find the first divisor, that's the smallest one. Then return n divided by that.\n\nSo let's code that.\n\nWait, but what if n is a prime number? For example, n=7. Then the smallest divisor greater than 1 is 7 itself. Then the largest proper divisor would be 7 divided by 7, which is 1. Which is correct. Because 7's divisors are 1 and 7. So the largest proper divisor is 1.\n\nSo in that case, the code would return 1.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Check if n is 1. Well, if n is 1, then there are no proper divisors, but according to the problem statement, n is given as a positive integer? Well, the function is supposed to return the largest divisor smaller than n. So for n=1, the largest divisor smaller than 1 is none, but maybe the function should return 1? Or maybe the function is designed for n >= 2?\n\nBut the problem says \"for a given number n\", but the example given is 15. Let me check the sample input. The example says largest_divisor(15) returns 5. So for n=15, the answer is 5. So for n=2, the answer would be 1, since 1 divides 2 evenly, and is smaller than 2.\n\nSo the code needs to handle all n >= 2?\n\nSo the approach is:\n\nLoop from 2 to sqrt(n) and find the smallest divisor. If no divisor is found (i.e., n is prime), then the largest proper divisor is 1.\n\nSo the code could be:\n\ndef largest_divisor(n: int) -> int:\n    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            return n // i\n    return 1\n\nWait, but wait. Let me test this with some examples.\n\nFor n=15: the loop runs from 2 to sqrt(15) ~3.87. So i=2, 15%2 is 1, not zero. Then i=3, 15%3 is zero. So returns 15//3=5. Which is correct.\n\nFor n=12: loop from 2 to"], "idxs": [1024], "new_tokens": [1024], "wall_time": [43.31800079345703]}], "tstamp": 1768908567.339324}

The user provided a Python function called split_words, but it's incomplete. The task is to complete this function based on the given description and examples.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the function is supposed to do. The docstring says that given a string of words, return a list of words split on whitespace. But if there are no whitespaces, split on commas. And if neither whitespaces nor commas exist, then return the number of lowercase letters with odd order in the alphabet. Oh right, ord('a') is 0, so 'a' is 0, 'b' is 1, ..., 'z' is 25. So for each lowercase letter, check if its position (ord - ord('a')) is odd. Then count how many such letters are present in the string.\n\nWait, but how does that work? Let me think again. The problem says: if no whitespaces exists in the text, you should split on commas. If no commas exists, then return the number of lowercase letters with odd order in the alphabet. So the priority is: first check for whitespace, then commas, then check for lowercase letters with odd order.\n\nWait, but the examples might help. Let's look at the examples:\n\nFirst example: split_words(\"Hello world!\") \u279e [\"Hello\", \"world!\"]. Here, there are whitespaces, so split on whitespace. The output is a list of words split by whitespace.\n\nSecond example: split_words(\"Hello,world!\") \u279e [\"Hello\", \"world!\"]. Here, there are no whitespaces, but there are commas. So split on commas. The string is split into \"Hello\" and \"world!\".\n\nThird example: split_words(\"abcdef\") == 3. So here, there are no whitespaces or commas. So we need to count the number of lowercase letters with odd order. Let's see: the letters are a, b, c, d, e, f. Their ordinals are 0,1,2,3,4,5. So the odd ones are 1,3,5. So positions 1 (b), 3 (d), 5 (f). So three letters. Hence the output is 3.\n\nSo the function needs to do the following steps:\n\n1. Check if there are any whitespaces in the input string. If yes, split on whitespace and return the list.\n\n2. If no whitespaces, check if there are commas. If yes, split on commas and return the list.\n\n3. If neither, then count the number of lowercase letters in the string that have an odd order (i.e., their position in the alphabet is odd). Then return that count.\n\nBut wait, how do we determine if there are whitespaces? Like, if the input string has any whitespace character (space, tab, newline?), then split on whitespace. But the examples use spaces. So maybe split on any whitespace, like splitting on any sequence of whitespace, but the examples show splitting on spaces. But the problem says \"split on whitespace\", which probably means splitting on any whitespace, like splitting the string into words based on whitespace.\n\nSo the first step is to split the string into words using whitespace as the delimiter. But if there are no whitespaces, then split on commas. But if there are no commas, then do the third step.\n\nBut how do we check if there are whitespaces? Like, if the string contains any whitespace character, then split on whitespace. So for example, if the string is \"Hello world\", split into [\"Hello\", \"world\"].\n\nBut if the string is \"Hello,world\", then there are no whitespaces, so split on commas, resulting in [\"Hello\", \"world\"].\n\nBut how do we split on commas? Like, split on commas, but commas are separators. So split on commas, but the commas are not part of the words. So for example, \"a,b,c\" would split into [\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"].\n\nBut then, if there are no commas, then we proceed to the third step.\n\nSo the function should first check if there are any whitespaces. If yes, split on whitespace. Else, check if there are commas. If yes, split on commas. Else, count the lowercase letters with odd order.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- Split the input string into tokens based on whitespace (split on whitespace). If there are any whitespaces, then split into words. But how? Like, using split() function?\n\nWait, but in Python, the split() function splits on any whitespace, so for example, \"Hello world\".split() would give [\"Hello\", \"world\"].\n\nBut if the string has no whitespaces, then split on commas. So for example, \"Hello,world\" would be split into [\"Hello\", \"world\"].\n\nBut if there are no commas, then we have to count the lowercase letters with odd order.\n\nSo the function"], "idxs": [1024], "new_tokens": [1024], "wall_time": [40.740280628204346]}], "tstamp": 1768908608.0823781}

The goal is to sort a list of integers based on the sum of their digits. And if there's a tie in the sum, then we order them by their original index in the list. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that when you sort a list in Python, you can use the key parameter in the sorted function. But here, the key isn't just the original numbers; it's the sum of their digits. So for each number in nums, I need to calculate the sum of its digits.\n\nWait, how do I calculate the sum of digits for a number? Let's take an example. Let's say the number is 11. The digits are 1 and 1, so sum is 2. For -1, the digits are -1? Or do I take absolute values? Wait, the problem says \"sum of their digits\". Let me check the example given.\n\nIn the example, the input is [1, 11, -1, -11, -12]. The output is [-1, -11, 1, -12, 11].

Let's compute the sum of digits for each element:\n\n-1: digits are -1? Or is it considering absolute value? Let's see the example. Let's take the first example input: [1, 11, -1, -11, -12]. Let's compute the sum of digits for each element.\n\n1: sum is 1.\n11: 1+1=2.\n-1: sum of digits. If we consider the digits as in the absolute value, then -1's digits are 1? Or does the negative sign count as a digit? Wait, maybe the problem considers the digits as the individual digits, including the sign? Or maybe not. Wait, maybe the sum is calculated as the sum of the digits in the number's absolute value. Or perhaps the digits are considered as their individual digits, but for negative numbers, maybe the negative sign is not part of the digits. Wait, this is confusing. Let me look at the example given.\n\nIn the example, the input list is [1, 11, -1, -11, -12]. The output is [-1, -11, 1, -12, 11]. Let's compute the sum of digits for each element:\n\nLet's take each element and compute the sum of their digits:\n\nFor -1: The digits are -1? Or is it 1? Because if we take the digits as the absolute value, then -1's digits are 1. But if we consider the digits as written, including the negative sign, then it's -1. But that would complicate things. Let me think.\n\nWait, the example output has -1 first. Let's see the order of the elements in the output. Let's look at the original list:\n\nOriginal list: [1, 11, -1, -11, -12]\n\nThe output is [-1, -11, 1, -12, 11].

But that would make the sum negative. But then, how does that fit with the example? Let's see:\n\nLooking at the output order: the first element is -1. Let's see what's the sum of digits for each element in the original list:\n\nOriginal elements:\n\n1 \u2192 sum of digits is 1.\n\n11 \u2192 1+1=2.\n\n-1 \u2192 digits are -1? Or is it 1? If we take the absolute value, then it's 1. But then, for -11, the digits are -1 and 1? Or is it the absolute value of the number?\n\nWait, maybe the problem considers the digits as the digits in the absolute value.

The user provided two functions, encode_shift and decode_shift, and wants me to complete them. Let me start by understanding what each function does.\n\nThe encode_shift function takes a string s and returns an encoded string by shifting every character by 5 in the alphabet. Wait, the code they provided uses ord(ch) and some modulo operations. Let me check the code again.\n\nLooking at encode_shift: The return statement uses a list comprehension. For each character ch in s, it's taking ord(ch), adding 5 minus ord('a'), then mod 26, then adding ord('a') again. Then it's converting back to a character with chr(). Hmm, maybe there's a mistake here.\n\nWait, let me think. The idea is to shift each character by 5 positions in the alphabet. For example, 'a' becomes 'f', 'z' becomes 'e' (since z is 25, adding 5 would be 30, mod 26 is 4, which is 'e'). But the code they have written seems to be shifting by 5, but maybe there's an error in the calculation.\n\nWait, let's break down the encode_shift code. The line is:\n\nchr(((ord(ch) + 5 - ord(\"a\")) % 26) + ord(\"a\"))\n\nSo, ord(ch) is the ASCII value of the character. Let's say ch is 'a', ord('a') is 97. Then ord(ch) +5 - ord('a') would be 97+5 -97 =5. Then mod 26 is 5. Then add ord('a') (97) again. So 5 +97=102. chr(102) is 'f', which is correct. So for 'a', adding 5 gives 'f'.\n\nBut what about if the character is 'z'? ord('z') is 122. ord(ch) +5 - ord('a') is 122 +5 -97 = 28. mod 26 is 28 -26 =2. Then add 97: 99. chr(99) is 'c'? Wait, no. Wait, ord('a') is 97. So 2 + 97 is 99, which is 'c'. But shifting 'z' by 5 should be 'e', right? Because z is the 25th letter (0-based?), adding 5 would be 30, mod 26 is 4, which is 'e'. Wait, but according to the code, for 'z', ord('z') is 122. ord(ch) +5 - ord('a') is 122 +5 -97 = 30. 30 mod 26 is 4. Then adding ord('a') (97) gives 4 +97 = 101, which is 'c'? That's not right. So there's a mistake here.\n\nWait, maybe the code is incorrect. Let me think again. The code is shifting each character by 5 positions forward. But when they do (ord(ch) +5 - ord('a')) %26 + ord('a'), that's supposed to be shifting by 5. But for 'z', ord('z') is 122. So 122 -97 =25 (since 'a' is 97). Adding 5 gives 30. mod 26 is 4. Then adding 97 gives 101, which is 'c'. But that's wrong. Because shifting 'z' by 5 should be 'e', which is 4th letter after 'z' (z is 25th letter, 0-based). So 25 +5 =30 mod26 is 4, so 'e'.\n\nWait, but the code is doing (ord(ch) +5 - ord('a')) %26 + ord('a'). So that's (original value - 'a') +5, mod26, then add 'a' again. So that's correct. Wait, but in that case, for 'z', (122 -97) is 25. Adding 5 gives 30. mod26 is 4. Then adding 97 gives 97+4=101, which is 'e' (since 'a' is 97, so 97 +4 = 101, which is 'e'). Oh wait, no. Wait, ord('a') is 97. So adding 4 gives 97 +4 = 101? No, 97 +4 is 101,"], "idxs": [1024], "new_tokens": [1024], "wall_time": [38.50122547149658]}], "tstamp": 1768908683.5668418}
