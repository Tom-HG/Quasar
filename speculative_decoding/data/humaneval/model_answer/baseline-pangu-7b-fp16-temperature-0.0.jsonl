But note: what about multiple separators?\n\n Alternatively, we can split the string by both spaces and commas? But the `split` method only takes one separator.\n\n We can use regular expressions to split by either a space or a comma.\n\n However, note the examples:\n Example 1: \"Hi, my name is John\" -> split by comma and space? But note that after splitting by comma we get [\"Hi\", \" my name is John\"] and then we have to split by space? But then we get \"my\", \"name\", etc.\n\n Another idea: split the string by commas first, then split each part by spaces? But then we have to flatten the list.\n\n Alternatively, we can split the entire string using a regular expression that matches either a comma or a space, but note that we don't want empty strings.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We can split the string using the regex pattern `[, ]+` which means one or more of either comma or space? But note: the example might have multiple consecutive separators.\n\n However, the problem says the words are separated by commas or spaces. So we can split by any sequence of commas and/or spaces.\n\n But note: what about leading or trailing spaces? The examples don't have any, but we should be safe.\n\n We can do: `words = re.split(r'[, ]+', s)` and then remove any empty strings.\n\n Example: \n   s = \"Hi, my name is John\" -> split by [, ]+ gives: ['Hi', 'my', 'name', 'is', 'John'] -> perfect.\n   s = \"One, two, three, four, five, six\" -> same.\n\n But what about: \"   Hello,  world!   \" -> we want ['Hello', 'world!']? \n However, note the problem says \"words\", and the example doesn't have exclamation. But the example output doesn't have the exclamation so we assume that the word includes any non-separator characters.\n\n Also, note the example output: \"Hi, my name is John\" becomes [\"Hi\", \"my\", \"name\", \"is\", \"John\"] -> so the comma after \"Hi\" is removed and we don't have any empty string.\n\n However, the split with regex `[, ]+` will split on the commas and spaces, and the leading and trailing splits might cause empty strings at the beginning or end.\n\n So we can do: `words = [word for word in re.split(r'[, ]+', s) if word != '']`\n\n Alternatively, we can use `split` without regex by converting commas to spaces and then split by space? But then we have to handle multiple spaces.\n\n Example: \n   s.replace(',', ' ').split() \n   This will replace every comma with a space, and then we can split without any arguments (which splits by any whitespace and removes any extra spaces) and returns non-empty strings.\n\n Let me test with: \n   s = \"Hi, my name is John\" -> replace commas: \"Hi  my name is John\" -> split() -> ['Hi', 'my', 'name', 'is', 'John'] -> correct.\n   s = \"One, two, three, four, five, six\" -> becomes \"One  two  three  four  five  six\" -> split() -> ['One', 'two', 'three', 'four', 'five', 'six'] -> correct.\n\n Also, what about: \"   Hello,  world!   \" -> \n   replace commas: \"   Hello   world!   \" -> split() -> ['Hello', 'world!'] -> which is what we want.\n\n So the simpler solution is: \n   s.replace(',', ' ').split()\n\n But note: what if there are hyphens or other punctuation? The problem doesn't specify, so we assume that the words are separated by commas or spaces and the words themselves may contain any characters.\n\n However, the problem says: \"split the string into words\" and the examples are simple. We are following the examples.\n\n But note: the example output for the first example includes \"John\" without any comma or space. So we are doing the right thing.\n\n However, what about other separators? The problem says commas or spaces. So we are replacing commas and then splitting by whitespace.\n\n But what about other commas? The problem says commas, so we only replace comma ','.\n\n Also, what about tabs or newlines?

Because if d is a divisor and d>n/2, then n/d is less than 2 (and since d<n, n/d>1). So the only divisor in that range is d=n? \n Actually, the divisors come in pairs: if d is a divisor and d<n, then n/d is also a divisor and n/d > n/d? \n\n Actually, if d is a divisor and d>n, then we don't consider because we are looking for divisors <n. \n But note: if d is a divisor and d<n, then we can also consider that the divisor pair is (d, n/d). Since d<n, then n/d must be greater than 1. \n And if d is less than n, then n/d is at least 2? Actually, if d is the smallest divisor (greater than 1) then n/d is the largest? \n\n Alternatively, we can iterate from n//2 down to 1?

Why? \n   If d is a divisor and d<n, then we have d <= n/d (if d<=sqrt(n)) or d>=sqrt(n) then n/d<=sqrt(n). \n   But note: the divisor d that is greater than sqrt(n) will have a pair n/d that is less than sqrt(n). \n   However, the largest divisor (other than n) must be at least sqrt(n) and at most n/2? \n\n Actually, the largest divisor (other than n) is the largest divisor in the set of divisors excluding n. \n And note: the divisor that is the largest (excluding n) must be at least ceil(n/2). \n Why? Because if n is even, then n/2 is a divisor and it's the largest (excluding n). \n        if n is odd, then the largest divisor below n must be at least (n+1)/2? \n\n But consider: n=15, the divisors are 1,3,5,15.

If there are no whitespaces and no commas, then we need to count the number of lower-case letters that have an odd order in the alphabet.\n    Note: The order: 'a' is 0 (even), 'b' is 1 (odd), 'c' is 2 (even), ... up to 'z' is 25 (odd).\n\n Important: We are only counting lowercase letters. We ignore uppercase and non-alphabet characters.\n\n How to check for whitespace? We can use `any(char.isspace() for char in txt)`\n How to check for commas? We can check if there is at least one comma: `',' in txt`\n\n However, note the problem says:\n   - if no whitespaces, then split on commas if commas exist, otherwise (if no commas) do the counting.\n\n But note: what if there are both whitespaces and commas? The problem says: \"split on whitespace\" if whitespaces exist.\n\n So the steps:\n\n  if there is any whitespace in `txt`:\n      return txt.split()   # note: split by default splits on any whitespace and removes extra spaces\n\n  else:\n      if ',' in txt:\n          return txt.split(',')\n      else:\n          # count the number of lowercase letters with odd index (i.e., index % 2 == 1)\n          count = 0\n          for char in txt:\n              if char.islower() and char != 'a': \n                  # Actually, we want to check the index: ord(char) - ord('a')\n                  # But note: 'a' is 0, so we can compute: \n                  # index = ord(char) - ord('a')\n                  # Then check if index % 2 == 1 (odd)\n                  # But note: we can also note that the odd order means the index is odd (like 1, 3, 5, ...)\n                  # However, note that the problem says: ord('a')=0, so we do:\n                  index = ord(char) - ord('a')\n                  if index % 2 == 1:\n                      count += 1\n                  # Alternatively, we can note that the odd order letters are the ones at odd positions in the alphabet.\n              # But note: we must skip non-alphabet and uppercase? The condition `char.islower()` ensures we only consider lowercase.\n\n          return count\n\n However, note: the example \"abcdef\" returns 3. Let's check:\n   a: 0 -> even -> skip\n   b: 1 -> odd -> count=1\n   c: 2 -> even -> skip\n   d: 3 -> odd -> count=2\n   e: 4 -> even -> skip\n   f: 5 -> odd -> count=3\n\n So it returns 3.\n\n But note: what if the string has non-alphabet characters? We are only counting lowercase letters.\n\n However, the problem says: \"if no whitespaces exist in the text you should split on commas\", meaning we only split if we find one of these delimiters. Otherwise, we do the counting.\n\n But note: what if the string is empty? \n   - If empty string: \n        whitespace? -> no\n        commas? -> no\n        then we count: no lowercase letters -> 0.\n\n Let's code accordingly.\n\n However, note: the problem says \"if no whitespaces exist in the text you should split on commas\", meaning we only split if we have commas? Actually, the problem says:\n   \"if no whitespaces exist in the text you should split on commas ',' if no commas exist\"\n\n So the condition for splitting on commas is only when there are no commas? Actually, the problem says: \"if no whitespaces exist in the text you should split on commas ',' if no commas exist you should return ...\"\n\n This is a bit ambiguous. Let me read again:\n\n   \"if no whitespaces exist in the text you should split on commas ',' if no commas exist\"\n\n Actually, it means: \n   - If there are whitespaces, split by whitespace.\n   - Else (there are no whitespaces), then:\n        - If there are commas in the text, split by commas.\n        - Else (there are no commas and no whitespaces), then do the counting.\n\n So we can code:\n\n   if any character is whitespace? -> split by whitespace.\n\n   else:\n        if there is at least one comma -> split by commas.\n\n        else -> do the counting.\n\n But note: what if the string has both whitespaces and commas?

Note: negative numbers should be handled by considering the absolute value for digit sum? \n But note: the example includes negative numbers.\n\n However, the problem says \"sum of their digits\". For negative numbers, we can consider the absolute value for digit extraction? \n But note: the example output orders by the digit sum and then by the original index.\n\n Let's compute the digit sums:\n\n For 1: 1 -> 1\n For 11: 1+1 = 2\n For -1: absolute value 1 -> 1\n For -11: absolute value 1+1 = 2\n For -12: absolute value 1+2 = 3\n\n So the digit sums: \n  1 -> 1\n  11 -> 2\n  -1 -> 1\n  -11 -> 2\n  -12 -> 3\n\n Now, if we sort by digit sum (ascending): \n  [1, -1] both have 1 -> then we break by original index: \n      element 1 is at index0, element -1 is at index2 -> so 1 comes before -1? \n      But the example output has -1 first, then -11.\n\n However, the example output: [-1, -11, 1, -12, 11]\n\n Let's check the indices of the original list:\n  -1: index 2\n  -11: index 3\n  1: index 0\n  -12: index 4\n  11: index 1\n\n Now, the example output: \n  First: -1 (index2) -> then -11 (index3) -> then 1 (index0) -> then -12 (index4) -> then 11 (index1)\n\n But note: the requirement says: if the digit sums are similar, order by the index in the original list (ascending).\n\n So for the two numbers with digit sum 1: \n   -1 (index2) and 1 (index0) -> we should order by index: so 1 (index0) should come before -1 (index2) because 0 < 2? \n   But the example output has -1 first and then 1 later.\n\n This contradicts. Let me re-read the example: \n   order_by_points([1, 11, -1, -11, -12]) == [-1, -11, 1, -12, 11]\n\n Alternatively, let me check the example's digit sums again. The problem says \"sum of their digits\". \n What if we consider the negative sign as part of the digit? That doesn't make sense because digits are non-negative.\n\n Actually, the common approach is to take the absolute value for digit sum. But the example output does not match that.\n\n Alternatively, the problem might be ordering by the digit sum in ascending order, but then if same, by the original index in ascending order? \n Then the two numbers with digit sum 1: \n   first: 1 (index0) and then -1 (index2) -> so [1, -1] for these two.\n\n But the example output has -1 first and then 1 later.\n\n Let me check the example output: \n   [-1, -11, 1, -12, 11]\n\n How about we compute the digit sum for negative numbers without absolute? \n   For -1: the digits are '-' and '1'? But that would be a negative sign and then a digit. How to sum? \n\n The problem says \"sum of their digits\". Typically, we consider the absolute value. \n\n But note: the example output: \n   -1: digit sum = 1? (if we take absolute) -> then 1 also 1 -> then they should be ordered by index: 1 (index0) then -1 (index2) -> so [1, -1] in the sorted list? \n\n However, the example output has -1 first and then 1 at the third position.\n\n Alternatively, the problem might mean: the absolute value of the number is taken for digit sum? \n   Then the digit sums are: \n        1: 1\n        11: 2\n        -1: 1\n        -11: 2\n        -12: 3\n\n Then we have:\n   digit_sum=1: [1 (index0), -1 (index2)] -> sorted by index: [1, -1] -> so the two smallest digit sums: 1 and -1.\n\n But the example output: [-1, ...] first.\n\n This is confusing.\n\n Let me check the example: \n   The example says: \n        order_by_points([1, 11, -1, -11, -12]) == [-1, -11, 1, -12, 11]\n\n How about we look at the digit sum for the entire set including negative? \n   For -1: we take the digits as the digits of the absolute value?"], "idxs": [1024], "new_tokens": [1024], "wall_time": [35.72424077987671]}], "tstamp": 1768896886.7193546}

We can handle negative modulo by:\n   We can adjust by adding 26 and then modulo 26 to keep it positive.\n\n Alternatively, we can do:\n   ((ord(ch) - ord('a') - 5) % 26) might be negative, so we can do:\n   ((ord(ch) - ord('a') - 5 + 26) % 26) + ord('a')\n\n However, note that modulo operation in Python for negative numbers: \n   We want to ensure that the result is in the range [0,25]. \n\n Let's break down:\n\n   Let x = (ord(ch) - ord('a') - 5) \n   Then we do (x % 26). But if x is negative, then x % 26 will give a positive remainder? \n   Actually, in Python, -5 % 26 gives 21, which is the same as 21 mod 26. That is what we want.\n\n Example: \n   Suppose we have 'a' encoded: \n        original 'a' -> (0+5)%26 = 5 -> 'f'\n   Now decode 'f': \n        (5 - 5) % 26 = 0 -> 'a'\n\n   But what about a character that wraps around?\n   Suppose we have 'v' (which is 21 in 0-indexed). \n        Encoding: (21+5) % 26 = 26 % 26 = 0 -> 'a'\n   Decoding: \n        (0 - 5) % 26 = -5 % 26 = 21 (because -5 + 26 = 21) -> 'v'\n\n So we can simply do: \n   decoded_char = chr( ( (ord(ch) - ord('a') - 5) % 26 ) + ord('a') )\n\n However, note that the modulo operation for negative numbers in Python does the right thing (returns a non-negative number in [0,25]).\n\n But wait: \n   Let's test: \n      (0 - 5) % 26 -> -5 % 26 = 21 (because 26 * 1 = 26, then -5 + 26 = 21)\n\n Therefore, we can write the decoding as:\n\n   return \"\".join([chr(((ord(ch) - ord('a') - 5) % 26) + ord('a')) for ch in s])\n\n However, note that the encoding function uses:\n   [chr(((ord(ch) + 5 - ord(\"a\")) % 26) + ord(\"a\"))]\n\n So the decoding function should be symmetric.\n\n But wait: the encoding function does:\n   (ord(ch) - ord('a') + 5) % 26 + ord('a')\n\n And the decoding function does:\n   (ord(ch) - ord('a') - 5) % 26 + ord('a')\n\n However, modulo operation: \n   In encoding: (x + 5) % 26, where x = ord(ch)-ord('a')\n   In decoding: (x - 5) % 26\n\n But note: (x + 5) % 26 is equivalent to (x - 5) mod 26? Not exactly, but they are inverses because:\n   (x + 5) mod 26 = y  =>  (x - 5) mod 26 = (y - 10) mod 26? \n\n Actually, we are applying the inverse operation: \n   To get x from y: we do (y - 5) mod 26? \n   But note: if we have y = (x+5) mod 26, then (y - 5) mod 26 = (x) mod 26? \n   However, because of modulo, we have to be cautious.\n\n Example: \n   x = 21 (v) -> y = (21+5)%26 = 0 (a)\n   Then (y-5) mod 26 = (0-5) mod 26 = 21 (v) -> correct.\n\n   x=0 (a) -> y= (0+5)%26=5 (f)\n   Then (y-5) mod 26 = (5-5)=0 (a) -> correct.\n\n So the formula is correct.\n\n Therefore, we can write the decode_shift function as:\n\n   return \"\".join([chr(( (ord(ch) - ord('a') - 5) % 26 ) + ord('a')) for ch in s])\n\n However, note that the above formula might be negative, but as we saw, the modulo operation in Python handles negative correctly.\n\n But let's test with a negative that doesn't require wrap:"], "idxs": [1024], "new_tokens": [1024], "wall_time": [35.64861607551575]}], "tstamp": 1768896922.3858562}
